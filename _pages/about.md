I received joint Erasmus Mundus MSc degree from University of Nottingham, University of Oviedo, and University of Rome and also a visiting scholar at the WEMPEC laboratory, University of Wisconsin Madison, USA. I was an Assistant Professor at AIUB. Currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Applied Physics from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. My research interests include photothermal energy conversion, 2D materials characterization, perovskite solar cells, and nonlinear optics.
